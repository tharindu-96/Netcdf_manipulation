# NetCDF

<p> A NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) file is a file format that is widely used in the scientific world, especially in fields such as meteorology, oceanography, climatology, and geoscience, to store and distribute multidimensional array-based scientific data.</p>

<p>NetCDF files are self-describing, which means they provide metadata in addition to the data itself, making them platform-independent and facilitating exchange and collaborating. They can store a wide range of data types, including scalar, vector, and grid-based data, and they allow compression and chunking for efficient large dataset storage and retrieval.</p>

<p>A NetCDF file is commonly structured using dimensions, variables, and attributes:</p>

<li> Dimensions: Determine the size of each dimension in the data arrays.</li>
<li>Variables: Store the actual data arrays and associate them with dimensions.</li>
<li>Attributes: Add more metadata to the variables, such as units, descriptions, and other details.</li>

# Scripts

<p>These scripts are designed to operate with yearly and monthly netCDF files. The annual average in the yearly script can be determined using the yearly netCDF files.  Seasonal scripts can be used to do monthly-based analyses using monthly netCDfs.
